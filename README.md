# The SOM algorithm 
is based on unsupervised, competitive learning. It provides a topology preserving mapping from the high dimensional space to map units.
In this implementaion the grid represente two-dimensional samples sampled as follow:

x1: Sampled from a uniform distribution on [-1, 1]
x2: Sampled from a uniform distribution on [-1, 1] In the probability of p, 
    and In the probability of 1-p Sampled from Sin(f x1) + epsilon where epsilon Sampled from Normal distribution.
